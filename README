Examples of running ESPERR to produce Regulatory Potential scores.

The Makefile in this directory contains a rule to build a Python
virtualenv that contains all of the bx-python and esperr code
needed. Just running "make esperr-virtualenv" should get 
everything set. 

Subdirectories contain rules for producing scores from specific
multiple alignments.

Alignments need to be downloaded separately and indexed with
maf_build_index.py

If you want scores in BigWig format you will also need to have
installed UCSC's wigToBigWig and twoBitInfo (or provide the
sizes file in some other way).
